        <p>As a family we love to travel to visit family. Delta, where I grew up, is always a favorite because my parents live there, and as my
        oldest says, &quot;It's the country, you can do anything there.&quot; We also love to visit my wife's dad in Texas. It's a long trip, but
        the kids love being at his house. The weather is always warm and there is a lot for them to do. They love the different creatures that
        they can catch as well.</p>
